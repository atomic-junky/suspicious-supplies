Tasty Supplies is a datapack that add a lot of new foods, recipes and even cooking mechanics in Minecraft by remaining Vanilla.
You'll be able to prepare a wide variety of delicious dishes from cookies to salad and pies.

## Features
For now, Suspicious Supplies add **+450 recipes** (several thousand if you count all the combinations).

To make a suspicious food you only need to place a bowl in a crafting slot with whatever you want (as long as it's not supposed to be eaten without consequences) and you have a suspicious food.

There is 6 big types of Suspicious food:
- Healthy Food
- Suspicious Food
- Contaminated Food
- Toxic Food
- Poisonous Food
- Lethal Food

The more unusal ingredients you add to your food, the more... suspicious the effects will be.
